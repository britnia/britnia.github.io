<h1>I <3 Ruby, the internet and potatoes.</h1>

<p>I had my first encounter with web development in 8th grade when I wrote the ugliest HTML of all time to produce the QUEEN of Geocities pages. That puppy had midi files, a sparkly GIF background and images that took like 3 years to load.</p>

<p>It wasnt until 10 years later when I was working as an IT intern at VML that I got a real taste of what modern web development is. The development intern that summer was unfamiliar with front-end and I, remembering what a BEAST I was at HTML, volunteered my services. Within a week I was pumping out CSS, generating new post types and configuring plugins. I even learned to make the site responsive with media queries. The whole thing was so exciting that I knew I had to do more.</p>

<p>I decided I needed to learn the ins and outs of computer science and enrolled in the master of science in applied computer science program at Columbus State University. I enjoyed learning about data structures, algorithms, discrete math, and object orientation but I felt like just as I found something I liked I had to drop it to move on to the next topic. I couldn't dig deep in the languages and frameworks I loved, because I had to keep up with whatever new thing the class moved on to. </p>

<p>I already knew I loved Ruby and I had done some previous dabbling in Ruby on Rails and I was burnt out on my assistantship so I decided it was time to make a HUGE change. I reduced my courseload to part time, resigned my assistantship and decided to dedicate myself completely to becoming a Ruby developer.</p>

<p>I just completed Test First Ruby and am currently enrolled in SkillCrush's Ruby on Rails Career Blueprint. I am also actively seeking internships and junior ruby on rails developer positions.</p>
