<p>I'm a self-taught software engineer, artist, former soldier, diversity enthusiast and bike life afficianado based in Atlanta, GA. 
I was formerly a member of Manheim's IFS Inventory API team with whom I wrote and maintaine Rails and Sinatra APIs in support of automotive auctions worldwide. Most recently I lent my software engineering and organizational talents to the Web Development team at AdHawk where I leveraged the AdWords and Facebook Marketing APIs in support of our Rails/GraphQL/React application.</p>

<p>I'm an advocate for junior developers and believe in the power of community to bridge the CS gap. To that end I've served as Event Coordinator on the Rails Girls Atlanta 
Board and speak frequently at meetups, student organizations and other events to which I am invited. I made my international conference speaking 
debut at Brighton Ruby in Brighton, England in July 2016.</p>

<p>I'm currently working looking for my next big adventure. I'd love to hear about any roles that would fit my skills and experience.
