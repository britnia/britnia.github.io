<p>I'm a self-taught software engineer, former soldier, diversity enthusiast and bike life afficianado based in Atlanta, GA. 
I'm currently a member of Manheim's IFS Inventory API team with whom I write and maintain Ruby APIs in support of automotive auctions worldwide.</p>

<p>I'm an advocate for junior developers and believe in the power of community to bridge the CS gap. To that end I serve as Event Coordinator on the Rails Girls Atlanta 
Board and speak frequently at meetups, student organizations and other events to which I am invited. I will make my international conference speaking 
debut at Brighton Ruby in Brighton, England in July 2016.</p>
