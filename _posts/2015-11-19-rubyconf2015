I was fortunate to have been selected as a RubyConf 2015 Oppertunity Scholar. This means that my registration and airfare were covered. It also means I had an instant community of other scholars and guides to navigate the conference. 

## Day 0
I arrived in San Antonio Saturday around noon and taxied to the hotel with one of my roommates, Heidi (conference speaker and technical write extrodinare) and we had a very tasty lunch of Italian food on the Riverwalk. Eventually my other two roommates, [Shana](https://twitter.com/Shay_nuh__) and [Alex](https://twitter.com/AAAckerman), showed up and we three headed to the scholar and guide welcome social. Free drinks and tasty apps were had by all. I met my guide, Sean, who gave me some T-shirts for his amazing event [Ruby for Good.](http://rubyforgood.org/). Afterward we headed over to [Se√±or Veggie](http://www.senorveggie.us/) where I had the most AMAZING vegan tacos for dinner. AMAZING is not an exageration.

## Day 1
On Sunday the real conference kicked off. [Cornina C. Zona](https://twitter.com/cczona) gave a very powerful opening keynote on creating responsible and compassionate algorithms. From there there I attended a whirlwind of amazing talks (which I will link here once Confreaks gets them up).

That night Stitchfix hosted a pub night with team trivia. I formed a rag tag band of misfits into a team and we won the $1000 prize. High on out victory we headed over to participate in the RubyConf tradition: Ruby Karaoke. This was, as you can imagine, the best thing that has ever happened. I sang a few songs and jumped in on a few group numbers but the best was a very fervent rendition of Snow's "Informer."

## Day 2
On Monday I met the writer of [Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/) and one of my Ruby heroes, [Michael Hartl](https://twitter.com/mhartl). He sat down at my lunch table and shared a great anecdote: "Sometimes I forget how to do something and look it up and my book comes up in Google as having the answer. At this point I am like, "wow, that guy who wrote this book is a lot smarter than the guy I am right now."

This was also the day for lightning talks. I was fortunated that I got into the final spot int he lineup (which basically means I was the closing keynote of day 2). I gave a very well received talk on my thoughts and strategies on the job hunt process and what its like looking for one's first developer job. See my slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mfPBrYe_zLRNRyvqSYp0Rca79AGbm6av2KY0AIVOXiE/edit?usp=sharing).

## Day 3
This day was like the last day of summer camp.
