I enrolled on the SkillCrush Ruby Developer Blueprint which is technically supposed to start today. Well, addict that I am, I'm already through week 2. To be fair, I have already learned most of what was covered in those sections but it was a good review and I learned some interesting meta information about Ruby and its community.

Skillcrush separates it's Blueprints into 3 one-month courses. This course is specifically focused on the Ruby language, the seond course is focused on Sinatra and ActiveRecord and the third is focused exclusively on Rails. I think I am most excited about the Sinatra and ActiveRecord section as I am least familiar with these but I think the Rails course looks like ti will go deeper than I have gone before and I am excited to produce some new projects!

As for my little website here, it is still a work in progress but Jekyll and GitHub pages made it SUPER fast to push out a good looking blog. The Jekyll installation is lightweight and fast and there are numorous themes available to install. You can use them as is to get a good looking product or you can use them as a starting point like I did. This them (dbyll) was great but the color scheme wasn't quite ME. I also wanted to add a few pages and Jekyll is so simple and straight forward that I didn't need ANY documentation to figure out where my new pages needed to live.  I think I'd like to start building some jekyll themes of my own!

Have a great day, internet!
