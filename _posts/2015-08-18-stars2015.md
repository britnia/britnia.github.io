This past weekend I had the opportunity to attend the **10th annual STARS Celebration of Diversity in Computing.** This conference was colocated with IEEE's 1st annual **Research on Equity and Sustained Participation in Engineering**, Computing and Technology (RESPECT). 

The focus of these conferences was on boradening participation in computing through education, research and outreach. I was privileged to present my poster *"Tech Girls Shine"* at RESPECT and gice a talk on "Leveraging Partnerships to Fund Outreach Events" at STARS.

It was very encouraging to see how other schools and communities are reaching out and getting women and minorities interested in computing careers. I was also excited to gain some new tools to bring back to CSU for our own outreach events.

I want to leave you all with the best quote from the event.

"\[Underrepresentation] is not a women's problem. It is not a minority problem. It is a national problem and we all need to work together to solve it regardless of race or gender."
