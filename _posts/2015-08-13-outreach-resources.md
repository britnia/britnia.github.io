On April 25, 2015 Columbus State University STARS Computing corps hosted Tech Girls Shine, a day of computing for 3rd through 5th grade girls in underserved schools. But we couldn't have done it on our own.

When you first get the idea for an outreach event it can be very exciting. But once you start dealing with the logistics it can be very daunting. The total cost for our event was about $3,000. Our budget was $0. But we were still made it happen. And you can too!

## Funding sources

### Grants
Yes, grants. The government, non-profits and even corporations have money set aside for community service, education and outreach. Our event was targeted at women in computing so we looked for grants that focussed on that.

* [NCWIT Student Seed Fund](https://www.ncwit.org/programs-campaigns/ncwit-awards/ncwit-student-seed-fund) This is the rant we applied for and received. They provice $1000 to support events which encourage women to enter STEM disciplines.

* [Anita Borg Pass it on Awards](http://anitaborg.org/awards-grants/pass-it-on-awards-program/) These are variable value grants ($500-$1000) for the purpose of furthering the involvement of women in computing. They can be used for events or for individual research of conference attendance 

### Organizations with similar goals

If you are passionate about reaching out to a specific group about computing, chances are someone else is too. And if you are lucky, that someone might have the money to help fund your event! There are 3 types of organizations you should look to for funding:

* Businesses 
* Non-profits
* Student Organizations

Businesses have a stake in encouring more involvement and diversity in computing. More technology professionals means more talent for them to choose from. Find the big tech chompanies and web development shops in your community and see if they would be willing to donate, provide a location or supply equipment.

There is likely a non-profit organization in or near your community with a similar target demographic as your event. Tech Girls Shine partnered with a local organization called Empowered Youth of Columbus which provides educational resources for children in low income communities. They helped us find children who could benefit from our program, provided transportation and showed up to the event as extra volunteers.

Whether or not you are in school, if there is a loal univversity you should reach out to student organizations interested in the same cause you are. For our event we worked with 2 student organizations outside our own. Our local ACM chapter provided volunteers and $600 for t-shirts for the event. The Student Government Association gave us $1429 for the purchase of 10 Kano computer kits.
