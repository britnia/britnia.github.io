Today I randomly decided that I wanted to get all of my STARS COmputing Corps students to a software conference. I wanted them to see that there is an entire awesome world of modern technology outside of our tiny corner of Georgia.

So I sent an email specifically asking for free tickets to a Connect.JS.

To my surprise I received a response back almost immediately. After speaking with the contact I was offered a set of passes. Then I needed a way to get the students to the conference. I emailed our faculty sponsor and BOOM Travel and Lodging funds were offered.

I am only posting this to say that if you want something just ask for it. Best case you'll get it and worse case they say no and you are no worse than when you started.

YOLO
